# add-walking-distance-to-transport-on-craigslist-sf
Bookmarklet that jacks into the Craigslist San Francisco apartment hunting map and adds visualizations of walk time walking to Bart and Muni stops. The green/yellow/red colors represent 5/10/15 minute walk times respectively. The stop data is inline and was hand scraped and shaped to get a working product as fast as possible during my last apartment search. Somebody should add the remaining MUNI lines and buses...
